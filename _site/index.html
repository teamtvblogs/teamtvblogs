<p class="lead">This is my <a href="/hello-world/">website</a>. </p>

<p> <img src=/assets/img/headshot.jpg alt = "Draped in America"></p>

<p>I believe that we can make the world even more amazing through attentiveness, genuine collaboration, equality, and training.</p>

<p>I'm a researcher and social justice advocate recently returned from a Fulbright to Ethiopia, working in the agricultural sector.</p>

<p>My family are probably ultimately responsible for my draw to agriculture, food, and justice. My mother in particular showed me the importance of cooking and growing food - as a means of sharing joy, of nourishment, and even as a way change how the world functions. As an adult I've since worked with food and agriculture from multiple angles of attack: scholar, perfectionist line cook, farmworker, activist. My work with agriculture now focuses on research, and on measuring, developing, and deploying effective ways to improve livelihoods through food and farming.<p>

<p>I work at the intersection of economics, agriculture, livelihoods, equity, and the environment. I'm passionate about preventing the worst impacts of climate change and food system instability (especially among smallholder farmers), and believe that pizza should probably not be considered a vegetable by US school lunch policy.  MS in Agroecology and Plant Pathology. Striving for integrity, rigor, and joy in personal and professional life.</p>

<p>Happy with loved ones especially my better half <a href="htttp://mighti.co">Valerie</a>, outdoors, with plants and animals around, learning a new language (human or machine), and exploring both new and familiar places. Problem with too many hobbies.</p>
