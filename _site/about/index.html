<blockquote><p>I believe that we can make the world even more amazing through attentiveness, genuine collaboration, equality, and training.</p></blockquote>

<p>My mother is probably the one ultimately responsible for my draw to agriculture, food, and justice. She showed me the importance of cooking and growing food - as a means of sharing joy, of nourishment, and even as a way change how the world functions. As an adult I've since worked with food and agriculture from multiple angles of attack: perfectionist line cook, farmworker, activist, scholar. My work with agriculture now focuses on scholarship, and on developing and employing effective ways to improve livelihoods through food and farming.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about preventing the worst impacts of climate change (especially among smallholder farmers), and believe that pizza should probably not be considered a vegetable by US school lunch policy.  MS in Agroecology and Plant Pathology and on a Fulbright grant to Ethiopia in 2016 for agriculture and climate change research. Striving for integrity, rigor, and joy in personal and professional life.</p>

<p>Happy with loved ones (especially my better half <a href="htttp://mighti.co">Valerie</a>), outdoors, with plants and animals around, and exploring both new and familiar places. Problem with too many hobbies.</p>
