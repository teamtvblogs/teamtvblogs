My mother is probably the one ultimately responsible for my draw to agriculture, food, and justice. She showed me the importance of cooking and growing food - as a means of sharing joy, of nourishment, and even as a way change how the world functions. As an adult I've since worked with food and agriculture from multiple angles of attack: perfectionist line cook, farmworker, activist, scholar. My work with agriculture now focuses on scholarship, and on developing and employing effective ways to improve livelihoods through food and farming.

I'm passionate about preventing the worst impacts of climate change (especially among smallholder farmers), and believe that pizza should probably not be considered a vegetable by US school lunch policy.  MS in Agroecology and Plant Pathology and on a Fulbright grant to Ethiopia in 2016 for agriculture and climate change research. Striving for integrity, rigor, and joy in personal and professional life.

Happy with loved ones (especially my better half <a href="htttp://mighti.co">Valerie</a>), outdoors, with plants and animals around, and exploring both new and familiar places. Problem with too many hobbies.
