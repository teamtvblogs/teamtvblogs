<p>Welcome! I am a development economics researcher and aspiring data
  scientist currently working for the World Bank and Dartmouth
  College, based in Madison Wisconsin. I work with very large
  datasets and an array of tools and techniques to extract meaning
  from messy and complex datasets. </p>

<p>I am inspired by: justice, causality, machine learning, human
learning, altruism, relationships (human and otherwise), kindness, and
wonder. I'm interested in finding ways to leave the world better than
  we found it, as I believe most people are.</p>

<p>Some of my technical aptitudes include strong proficiency in
  Python, Stata, Matlab, and R; strong experience in statistical
  programming and causal inference; experience with ML algorithms
  including RF, SVM, and a variety of neural network architectures;
  GIS and geospatial techniques; and visualization both in statistical
  languages and front-end web apps including the use of D3.js. For a
  more comprehensive representation of my skills, please see

  my <a href="https://github.com/tobylunt">Github</a>.</p>
