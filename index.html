<p>Welcome! I am co-founder and chief data scientist at the
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.devdatalab.org/">Development
  Data Lab</a>. I work with an array of tools and techniques to
  extract meaning from messy, complex, large datasets - delivering
  insights and open sourcing data and software to fight poverty around
  the world. </p>

<!-- <p>I often use Python, Stata, Matlab, R, and QGIS; my work relies on
  statistical programming and causal inference, as well as
  classification and regression algorithms and geospatial
  techniques. I also do front-end visualization work, both in
  statistical languages and web apps including the use of D3.js,
  Django, and various other fun things. For a more comprehensive
  representation of my skills, please see my <a href="http://tobiaslunt.com/assets/cv.pdf">CV</a> or
  my <a href="https://github.com/tobylunt">Github</a>.</p>
-->
<p>I am inspired by: altruism, resilient automation, machine and human
learning, and wonder. I'm interested in finding ways to leave the
world better than we found it, as I believe most people are.</p>
