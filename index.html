<p>Welcome! I am a data scientist and international development
  researcher scientist currently working for the Development Data
  Lab. I work with very large datasets and an array of tools and
  techniques to extract meaning from messy and complex data. </p>

<p>I often use Python, Stata, Matlab, R, and QGIS; my work relies on
  statistical programming and causal inference, as well as
  classification and regression algorithms and geospatial
  techniques. I also do front-end visualization work, both in
  statistical languages and web apps including the use of D3.js,
  Django, and various other fun things. For a more comprehensive
  representation of my skills, please see my <a href="http://tobiaslunt.com/assets/cv.pdf">CV</a> or
  my <a href="https://github.com/tobylunt">Github</a>.</p>

<p>I am inspired by: justice, causality, machine learning, human
learning, altruism, relationships (human and otherwise), kindness, and
wonder. I'm interested in finding ways to leave the world better than
  we found it, as I believe most people are.</p>
