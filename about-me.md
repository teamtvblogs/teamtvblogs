<p>I believe that we can make the world even more amazing through attentiveness, genuine collaboration, equality, and training.</p>

<p>I'm a researcher and social justice advocate recently returned from a Fulbright to Ethiopia, working in agricultural development.</p>

<p>My family are probably ultimately responsible for my draw to agriculture, food, and justice. My mother in particular showed me the importance of cooking and growing food - as a means of sharing joy, of nourishment, and even as a way change how the world functions. As an adult I've since worked with food and agriculture from multiple angles of attack: scholar, perfectionist line cook, farmworker, activist. My work with agriculture has brought me to economic development. I now focus on research and on measuring, developing, and deploying effective ways to improve livelihoods around the world.<p>

<p>I work at the intersection of economics, agriculture, livelihoods, equity, and the environment. I'm passionate about preventing the worst impacts of climate change and food system instability (especially among smallholder farmers). I believe that pizza should probably not be considered a vegetable by US school lunch policy. Striving for integrity, rigor, and joy in personal and professional life.</p>

<p>I'm most happy with loved ones especially my better half [Valerie](http://mighti.co), outdoors, with plants and animals around, learning a new language (human or machine), and exploring both new and familiar places. I have a problem with too many hobbies.</p>
