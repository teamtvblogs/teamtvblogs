This site was built with Jekyll and is hosted on Github. Despite the limitations of static websites, I highly recommend Jekyll as a blogging platform. It's pretty great. I borrowed from the brilliant work of [ghjaru](http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) - thanks! Fonts include Caviar Dreams, Arizona, and Source Sans Pro.   

I believe that we can make the world even more amazing through attentiveness, collaboration, equality, and training. I work at the intersection of economics, agriculture, livelihoods, equity, and the environment. Striving for integrity, rigor, and joy in personal and professional life.   

I'm most happy with loved ones especially my better half [Valerie](http://mighti.co), outdoors, with plants and animals around, learning a new language (human or machine), and exploring both new and familiar places. I have a problem with too many hobbies.
