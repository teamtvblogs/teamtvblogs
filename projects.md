![Whitman]({{ teamtvblogs.github.io }}/assets/img/whitman-archive.png "Whitman")

Machine learning amazes me - and so does my brother in law [Aaron Moe](http://aaronmoe.com), professor of English, literature genius, and ecopoeticist. Whenever I hang out with Aaron, I learn something. Among many things, Aaron is an expert on E.E. Cummings and the works of Walt Whitman. One of our conversations led to an idea: what if we were to adapt [some](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) of the [advances](https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/02/neural-network-journalism-philip-k-dick/) of leading machine learning engineers to mimic the prose of Whitman? You could feed the bot a "seed" of a few words, and then see how Walt might finish your sentence.

Clearly we didn't expect to create anything that would be an actual replacement for Whitman himself, but we thought it would be a fascinating experiment to train a neural network in this way and see what we got. Aaron could provide a relatively extensive archive of Walt's writings, and I could build the ANN. [Read on]({{ teamtvblogs.github.io }}/whitman-bot/).

![Ariadne]({{ teamtvblogs.github.io }}/assets/img/ariadne.png "Ariadne")

Alright, it's finally become clear: I might not be totally right in the head. I, along with my two closest friends, just bought a 90 year old wooden boat. Ariadne needs a lot of work. We are planning for a 3-5 year restoration before she returns to her normal self. I'll try to record some of the process in periodic blog posts, but for now, enjoy this [first one]({{ teamtvblogs.github.io }}/beautiful-disaster/).

![Shiny]({{ teamtvblogs.github.io }}/assets/img/shiny-header.png "R Shiny")

In an effort to explore the vast possibilities of R Shiny, I built a very simple Shiny app using data from a survey designed and conducted with colleagues in Ethiopia. The data explores the relationships between different seed potato storage technologies (which turn out to be very important!) under different hypothetical future conditions.

Despite the limitations both in form and function of this app, it was enough to demonstrate the amazing power not only for sharing information - but also for uncovering patterns and trends that would be more difficult to discern without good visualization.

Check out the blog post on the project [here]({{ teamtvblogs.github.io }}/shiny-potatoes/).
