[![Senate Cash]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/assets/img/senate_cash.png "Senate Cash")]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/tag/senate_cash/)

**TL;DR:** My best friends and I bought a 90 year old wooden sailboat, and are restoring her in Maine. This is a large, medium-term woodworking project, and I hope to post occasionally to catalogue some of our progress. [Here is a list of posts on this topic.]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/tag/ariadne)
