[![Whitman]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/assets/img/whitman-archive.png "Whitman")]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/tag/whitman/)

**TL;DR:** leveraging commonly available modern deep learning techniques, I'm inspired by my brother in law's scholarship to create a generative Recurrent Neural Network to create a Walt Whitman-like bot. [Here is a list of posts on this topic.]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/tag/whitman/)

[![Ariadne]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/assets/img/ariadne.png "Ariadne")]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/tag/ariadne/).

**TL;DR:** My best friends and I bought a 90 year old wooden sailboat, and are restoring her in Maine. This is a large, medium-term woodworking project, and I hope to post occasionally to catalogue some of our progress. [Here is a list of posts on this topic.]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/tag/ariadne)

![Shiny]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/assets/img/shiny-header.png "R Shiny")

**TL;DR:** I played around with R Shiny's capabilities in a toy example, visualizing some simple survey data from my time in Ethiopia. Check out the blog post on the project [here]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/shiny-potatoes/).
