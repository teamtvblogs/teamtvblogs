Is new technology a panacea for solving global hunger, malnutrition, and poverty? Or is it shortsighted, wishful thinking to believe that humankind will develop technological solutions to free ourselves of our most intractable problems?

Many conversations that I have about the future, and the development of future technologies, wind their way towards one of these two extremes. This is counterproductive, and it colors over the nuances that will help to shape our future century.

Technological solutions themselves do not usually pose instrinsic problems simply through their existence, unless they come with inherent existential risks, like the development of the hydrogen bomb. The challenges presented by new technologies, such as the disenfranchisement of vulnerable populations, narrowing of choices through oligopoly, and environmental and social externalities, are products of underlying <i>power structures</i>. Namely: who gets to choose what technologies are developed, and how they are applied?

When thinking about future technology within the frame of power dynamics, the way we consider these issues shifts in subtle but meaningful ways. Demonizing individual technologies is no longer fruitful. Instead, we ask ourselves: what are the structural determinants of how solutions to global problems are developed? What are the institutionalized patterns (formal or informal) that are leading to improper or unjust application of particular technologies? How can we as a global society push our processes of technological development to maximize equity and productivity? How can we expand the principles of open-source?

From an agricultural lens, it is clear that some technologies are benefical to some groups at the expense of others, while on the other hand, certain technological developments can be used to assemble key suites of tools to help tackle our most insurmountable problems (think climate change and climate-smart agricultural practices). To write off "technology" as inherently unjust, or as merely dangerous and exploitative tools of multinationals writ large, is to cheapen the wise counsel of prudence - our dire need for an eye towards equity in the development of our future tools. Similarly, to consider "technology" as <i>deus ex machina</i> to sweepingly solve our most wicked global problems, is a discredit against the importance of arming our collective society with all of the tools we can muster as we work to make the world safer, healthier, more productive, and more just.

Instead of blaming the tools, we must consider the toolmakers and the judgement of those using them. We should aim for a productive technological justice that benefits all, even the weakest and poorest, while rewarding both private and public investment. Our tools reflect our collective values. We should strive for the tools we use to express values that we are proud of.
