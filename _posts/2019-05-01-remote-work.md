When you are restoring a boat in another state, you do whatever you
can to optimize the time that you have at the boat - which means
making as many parts as you can remotely then installing them in situ.

<!--more-->

The most recent escapade on this front has involved working towards
 three primary goals:
 * Laminate 20 frame blanks for installation in the forward
third of the boat, strengthening the area around the forestay all the
way back to the mast step, and tying the planking to the new forefoot
and floor timbers previously installed;
* Strengthen and refinish three cockpit benches, four
  lazarettes, and various pieces of cabin and cockpit sole;
 * Build a new, much larger mast step to adequately transfer the loads
  from the mast butt across the floor timbers and aft towards the
  ballast keel.

Today we'll talk about the frames and the lazarette and bench rebuilds.

## NEW FRAME BLANKS

Unfortunately, Ariadne has a crack in nearly two thirds of her
frames. A handful of them have been sistered, but many are in such
poor condition that they need to be replaced. Rather than steaming in
square oak stock as originally done, we've elected to template the
curves at each station and laminate new frames from upsized
quartersawn white oak stock. Steaming in new frames would be quicker,
but would be easiest to do after removing the covering boards - a step
we're not quite ready to take.

We templated the exterior of the boat at each station, then inset the
curve by 5/8" (the thickness of the planking) to create the correct
curve for each frame. We marked each curve on a sheet of 3/8"
plywood for transport back to Wisconsin, then built a strongback
underneath the plywood to ensure stiffness and provide a firm clamping
surface. Using this method, we were able to glue up laminated frame
blanks in batches of three.

After removing the plastic sheeting from the clamping table, you can
see more clearly how simple the process is: 
* Screw 2x4 blocks to the table with a 5/8" offset
* Plastic sheeting (trash bags)
* Glue up
* Clean up

For the glue-up, we used six 1/4" laminates and G-Flex epoxy. We faced
and squared the blanks for transportation back to the boat - for
installation, we will cut rolling bevels to match the mating face with
the interior of the planking and cut them to length.

## BENCHES, LAZARETTES, AND SOLES

Nearly all components of the cockpit joinery require repair of some
kind. We begin by removing all the pieces that we could to work on
them in Wisconsin. Cockpit (and cabin) sole pieces needed to be
stripped and reinforced - nearly all the wood in the boat including
the topsides has a dark patina to it due to years of gradual oxidation
and the layering of innumerable coats of varnish. The removal of the
dirty, uneven varnish left us with a clean substrate for structural
repairs, and will give us a very beautiful finish.

The best method we've found for bulk removal of unwanted accumulated
varnish (and paint) layers has been through the combination of heat
and scraping. Varnish can be warmed to the point where it begins to
bubble ever so slightly without damaging the underlying wood, which
makes it possible to remove the heated layer with only a gentle
mechanical action.

The remaining work was largely reinforcing as much of the existing
material as we could salvage, by attaching new backing pieces with
epoxy before refinishing.

## HATCH COVERS

The cockpit, fore, and aft hatch covers were all in pretty rough
shape. These are essential (and beautiful) original pieces of the
boat, made of honduran mahogany in dimensions that are impossible to
find anywhere anymore. We took extra special care to rebuild these
pieces by replacing the stiffening longitudinal and athwartship rails
that give the hatch covers their strength.

## FINISHING

Varnish, varnish, everywhere.
