[![Plank ends]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/assets/img/IMG_2673.jpg)]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/fore-planking/)

In order to access the forefoot, we had to remove eight courses of
planking at their leading edges - where the forwardmost points of the
planks attach to the spine of the boat. Here, we splice and install
new mahogany to replace these key bits.

<!--more-->

Both understandably and irritatingly, the forwardmost ends of these
planks were edge-nailed downward into the backbone of the boat - this
makes sense, as these pointy plank ends are quite delicate due to the
long overhangs of the boat, and are too narrow to get screws very far
forward. Functionally for us, it meant that even in cases where the
planks were strong enough to be reused, there was no way to get the
plank ends removed without destroying them.

The leading (hood) ends of these forward planks showed symptoms of the
problems one would expect. Hood ends have exposed end grain which
wicks in moisture, and can be susceptible to damage due to freeze/thaw
over the winter months. So replacing these bits was going to have to
happen regardless of whether we replaced the forefoot.

## Scarfing
![Scarf]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/assets/img/IMG_2668.jpg "scarf")

The fix was to scarf new lengths of mahogany to replace the damaged
wood as far back as necessary. The scarf itself is a 12:1 angle, cut
with a router jig built to meet this specification. You ease off the
plank fasteners far enough back to spring the plank end, fit the
router over the end, clamp it down with a wooden wedge inside to keep
the target plank firmly against the jig, and go to town with your
router.

## Installation
Once the scarf is cut into the old plank, the new piece must be
shaped, scarfed to match, and glued to the old plank. This can be a
pretty fiddly process, even when spiling to get the shape as accurate
as possible.

This boat is particularly finicky as there is no caulking - Ariadne is
of tight-seamed carvel construction. So it's very important to get the
seams as close as possible when replacing planks. There is a risk of
cracked frames if things are too tight, but experts recommend getting
it as tight as possible as opposed to trying to leave even spacing
between planks (which is effectively impossible).

A good old fashioned bit brace is an essential tool for fastening in
the finished plank ends.
