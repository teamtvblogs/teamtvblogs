In order to access the forefoot, we had to remove eight courses of
planking at their leading edges - where the forwardmost points of the
planks attach to the spine of the boat. Here, we splice and install
new mahogany to replace these key bits.

<!--more-->

Both understandably and irritatingly, the forwardmost ends of these
planks were edge-nailed downward into the backbone of the boat - this
makes sense, as these pointy plank ends are quite delicate due to the
long overhangs of the boat, and are too narrow to get screws very far
forward. Functionally for us, it meant that even in cases where the
planks were strong enough to be reused, there was no way to get the
plank ends removed without destroying them.

The leading (hood) ends of these forward planks showed symptoms of the
problems one would expect. Hood ends have exposed end grain which
wicks in moisture, and can be susceptible to damage due to freeze/thaw
over the winter months. So replacing these parts was going to have to
happen regardless of whether we replaced the forefoot.

## Scarfing
![Scarf]({{ tobylunt.github.io }}/assets/img/IMG_2668.jpg "scarf")

The fix was to scarf new lengths of mahogany to replace the damaged
wood as far back as necessary. The scarf itself is a 12:1 angle, cut
with a router jig built to meet this specification. You ease off the
plank fasteners far enough back to spring the plank end, fit the
router jig over the end, clamp it down with a wooden wedge inside to keep
the target plank firmly against the jig, and go to town with your
router.

## Installation
Once the scarf is cut into the old plank, the new piece must be
shaped, scarfed to match, and glued to the old plank. This can be a
pretty fiddly process, even when spiling to get the shape as accurate
as possible.

This boat is particularly finicky as there is no caulking - Ariadne is
of tight-seamed carvel construction. So it's very important to get the
seams as close as possible when replacing planks. There is a risk of
cracked frames if things are too tight and then expand when taking up
moisture from the ocean, but experts recommend getting it as tight as
possible as opposed to trying to leave even spacing between planks
(which is effectively impossible).

A good old fashioned bit brace is an essential tool for fastening in
the finished plank ends. We use longer screws into the floor timbers
and shorter ones into the frames.

## Finished

Despite a couple of hiccups along the way, we managed to get four
courses of plank ends installed in about a week (along with some other
projects). Scott did a lot of the heavy lifting here. We are very
happy with how they turned out. It feels very good to cut out bad wood
and replace it with top shelf mahogany. We will do the next four
courses, as well as building new garboards, and bung all the screw
countersinks in one go. We also still need to fair the planking in to
a nice smooth consistent shape, and revarnish everything.

## Odds and ends

During this trip we also replaced all of the old floor timber
bolts. Remember those? The corroded iron bolts are no longer, and have
been swapped out for 5/8" silicon bronze. We ended up buying carriage
bolts and chopping of the shoulders to make a T shape, which could
then be hammered into the narrow cutwater of the forefoot.

We also brought the rebuilt companionway hatch cover back to Maine, and got
some nice closure on the newly-bolted floor timbers up forward. So
beefy.

## Templating

Lastly, we templated two dozen new frames by mounting a templating
tool to the outside of the boat. We will inset each of these curves by
the planking thickness (5/8") to make the curve fit inside of the
boat. These will be made of laminated white oak using G-Flex epoxy,
and will significantly strengthen the forward section of the boat.
