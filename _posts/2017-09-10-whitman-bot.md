Machine learning amazes me - and so does my brother in law [Aaron Moe](http://aaronmoe.com), professor of English, literature genius, and ecopoeticist. Whenever I hang out with Aaron, I learn something. Among many things, Aaron is an expert on E.E. Cummings and the works of Walt Whitman. One of our conversations led to an idea: what if we were to adapt [some](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) of the [advances](https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/02/neural-network-journalism-philip-k-dick/) of leading machine learning engineers to mimic the prose of Whitman? You could feed the bot a "seed" of a few words, and then see how Walt might finish your sentence.
