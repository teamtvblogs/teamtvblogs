The forefoot is an essential piece of Ariadne's structural timber - a
14' long section of her backbone. The forefoot was totally shot - full
of splits and dry rot; it could be pierced all the way through with a
knife at multiple points along its length.

This was a large project with multiple stages, but was completed much
more quickly than expected due to the herculean efforts of my buddy
Scott, the most talented woodworker of the three of us by far. 

## Templating and mockup

We knew we had to replace the forefoot as it was irreparably damaged,
so our first step was to construct a template that we could use to
strategize and mock up our replacement piece. This was done by
springing plank ends, bolting together pieces of thin pattern ply,
cutting grooves to fit around the floor timbers and frames, and
placing it up next to the original forefoot. Once in position, we
could trace the exact shape of the existing forefoot to create a
rough-cut piece.

We decided to build the new forefoot out of laminated 2" lengths of
white oak. Solid lumber would have been better for this purpose, but
we had access to G-Flex and 2" oak stock and decided that urgency
trumped perfection in this case. We need to get Ariadne back in the
water. We don't expect the G-Flex to fail, but if it does, we can
always replace this piece again if need be. So we went ahead with our
plan and laminated the pieces together to accommodate our
template. Can never have enough cheap clamps!

The blank was then cleaned up, joints inspected, and readied for
shaping.

![Ariadne](@/assets/img/forefoot_mockup.jpg "Forefoot blank")

The shape was cut by placing the template on top of the blank,
drilling small holes through the template into the piece underneath,
and then marking the finished line with a flexible batten. Cuts were
made on Scott's fancy new Laguna bandsaw.

At the end of this process, Scott had built a nice squared blank to
match the template we had made. He brought the new piece to the boat to
begin the process of shaping and installation.


## Removing the old forefoot

Before you get the new thing in, you have to get the old one out! This
was a somewhat involved process, but no more so than any other task on
a wooden boat. The bolts holding the old floor timbers to the forefoot
needed to be removed - and were completely corroded away, as they were
made of iron. Bronze wood screws fastening plank ends to forefoot
rabbet needed to be backed out. Many broke or were spinners and had
to be cut away.

Once the old forefoot was removed, we were treated to a nice view of
the new floor timbers we had installed (see [this post](/posts/2018-07-24-floor-timbers/) 
for more info on that process). You can see that we cut off many hood ends of the planks in
this area; the planks needed to be sprung back to release the old
forefoot, but many of them were damaged and were cut away for later
replacement. Hood ends of planks (as well as butt joints) are
commonly damaged due to the freeze/thaw process of moisture that seeps
into the end grain.

## Shaping the piece and cutting the rabbet

Comparing the old forefoot to the new blank was pretty
striking. However, the new piece still needed to be shaped, and the
rabbet to be cut. The rabbet is a groove cut into the backbone of the
boat that the edges of the lowest planks set perfectly into - this
joint is essential for the seaworthiness of the boat. If you have a
bad rabbet, your boat's going to leak!

Here's a closer look, comparing the quality of the old forefoot to the
new white oak. Note that the square holes are for the bungs covering
the floor timber bolts, originally made out of iron.

Now, when it comes to cutting the rabbet, we had a decision to
consider. Most boats built in North America cut a 90 degree rabbet
symmetrically, such that the distance from the inner rabbet to the
bearding line matches the distance from the inner rabbet to the outer
(lower) rabbet. However, in scandinavia where Ariadne was built, the
entire rabbet is inset towards the cutwater in the center of the keel
timber (forefoot in this case).

![Ariadne](@/assets/img/forefoot_rabbet_comparison.png "Rabbet types")

The reason that the scandinavians would have found this desirable is
that it increases the bearing surface of the plank on the rabbet - the
plank will rest on the upper surface of the rabbet, from the inner
rabbet line to the bearding line. We chose to continue this
approach. The rabbet was cut with a Lie Nielsen side rabbet plane,
working down gradually to the correct dimensions, and test-fitting
with a piece of plank to ensure the proper fit.

The rabbet was cut in sections, with a lot of test-fitting and
comparison to the old forefoot. The roughly 10' straight section in
the middle of the forefoot was the simplest to cut, while the aft and
forwardmost lengths needed to be faired in when test-fit on the boat
itself.

## Test fitting

Test-fitting was essential for fairing in the rabbet correctly, but
also to ensure the forefoot itself came to the necessary final
dimensions. The photo below shows the testing of the rabbet, before the
after end of the forefoot has begun to take shape.

Up forward, we see the process of Scott shaping the cutwater to match
the original profile and fit correctly with the stem. The cutwater
here is being shaped before the forwardmost section of rabbet has been
built.

![Ariadne](@/assets/img/forefoot_fitting_fore.jpg "Fitting forward")

At the aftmost end of the forefoot, we have the endearingly named
"cobra head" - a flared section of timber that is shaped to fill what
was previously an interior void that trapped water with no possibility
of egress. We're not sure why this was built that way originally, as
all the floor timbers have limber holes to allow for the flow of water
back to the bilge. However, without our new cobra head, there was an
impassable dam that would not allow water aft of the forefoot-keel
timber joint. The cobra head fills this space entirely. This feature
was initally shaped with a chisel to roughly approximate the correct
dimensions, then faired in by eye with a block plane, sandpaper, and
Scott's good judgment.

The final appearance of the "cobra head." Looking nice and fair. A
filler block will eventually be added on the underside of the
forefoot, to fill in a small void in the leading edge of the deadwood.

## Priming and install

After a half dozen test fits and tons of planing and sanding, it was
time for installation. First, we decided to prime the piece with a few
coats of anti-microbial paint. Note, however, that we ended up not
priming the rabbet or the cutwater. The cutwater will be externally
visible and will thus be varnished above the waterline; below the
waterline it will be primed and coated with bottom paint. We're not
sure if we should paint the rabbet so will ask around before doing
so. Jay's enjoying the process of the first coat:

![Ariadne](@/assets/img/priming_forefoot.jpg "Priming")

After priming and the final test-fit, it was installation time. We
used dolfinite as a bedding compound, which is non-structural but will
prevent the transmission of moisture through joints. The forefoot was
bolted forward to the stem and aft to keel timber using temporary
bolts, which will be replaced by upsized silicon bronze. We have yet
to cut stopwaters for these joints, and will do so using softwood
dowels.
