Everyone knows that money is the lifeblood of politics, and that those
with more of it have a bigger influence on our national political
economy than those who don't. But how are our representatives doing?
Who is bankrolling their campaigns? I build a webapp, from soup to
nuts, to find out.

This project retrieves the data in a couple of ways, scrapes senator
headshots, runs some simple SQL queries to summarize, and the web app
is built in the Django framework with the viz running D3 v3. So all of
this gets done with Python, postgres, Bash, and some JS.  

This is a work in progress. For the code and a decent README,
see the [Github repo](https://github.com/tobylunt/senate_cash).
