Sometimes I get the chance to help out in a professional kitchen and try to remember how to hack it. I love these opportunities because they remind me what I loved so much about that life: the wordless passion for mastery, the playfulness and creativity, and the kind and committed people. They also remind me why I left. It's a hard life. 

My buddy [Andy Jack](https://www.instagram.com/ajjack_) is an old friend from my days back at L'Ã‰toile and is truly a gifted and curious cook - sometimes we'll collab on a project or he'll invite me to help out with one of his projects. I'd like to share two of these experiences - first when I helped out at Andy's popup at [Fairchild](https://www.fairchildrestaurant.com/), and then when Andy and I put together a dinner at [Robinia Courtyard](https://robiniacourtyard.com/).

This was a one-off popup put together by Andy and Itaru, owner and chef at [Fairchild](https://www.fairchildrestaurant.com/). Seeing these guys put together and execute the menu was SO fun because they are both incredibly collaborative as well as extremely talented.

Making chocolate shell is easy and doesn't require any special ingredients - you just need to use a fat that turns solid at ice cream temperature."

## Robinia popup

Before the Fairchild event, Andy and I had put together a popup at [Robinia Courtyard](https://robiniacourtyard.com/) for a winter dinner series. We cooked for only maybe fifty people, who all ate inside the courtyard's snow globe domes. 

Our orientation was to make simple, family-style food with deep flavors that would let us sell tickets at a low price point. Fine dining taught us a lot, but we wanted to break out of the exclusivity trap and deliver food we'd want to eat and share with friends and family.
